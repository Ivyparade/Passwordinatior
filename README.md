# Unique-Password-Generator-name

So this *uniquely and imaginatively named* password generator works by combining strings to a master string, allowing the script to use a
string that contains only the selected character types for the actual password generation part.

I haven't got an actual menu with options to select working as of this commit. I'll try to get it done, but barring that, a prompt
and a series of confirmations work for basic functionality.
